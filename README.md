# Restraurant_Management_system_python
This is a beginner-level Python project that simulates a basic restaurant ordering system. The program displays a menu with item names and prices, takes the user's order through input, checks availability, and calculates the total bill. It also allows the user to place multiple orders without restarting the program.
